v0.0.1.29
-Replaced urllib.urlopen() with HTTP.Request() from the plugin framework.

v0.0.1.28

v0.0.1.27 
-Check for a valid host setting. If the host is unreachable, reset to localhost:32400
-Sometimes the web client will reload the scanStatus and if the scanner was not running it would trigger a new scan. It now presents a menu to view the last results or go to the main menu.
-Moved ignored files checking from findUnmatchedFiles() to listTree() to put it alongside checking .plexignore. This helps optimize the code a bit.
-Cleaned up some unnecessary code.
-bScanStatusCount will now only count valid files in listTree(). Allows a more accurate count of the expected number of files from the database.

fixed backslash getting escaped on windows platform

V0.0.1.8:

Fixed a brainfart from my part, cutting off the last caracter in the html reporting

V0.0.1.7:

As a partial workaround for a channel timeout of the API, when scanning a HUGE section, I devided the search into 3 different steps.
Still not perfect, and will still timeout for some people, but as said, only with either a HUGE section, a non-optimized database or a slow file-system.
I'm still scratching my head here on how-to solve this, but haven't given up yet.

Fixed errors with strange caracters
Fixed issue when running on windows @ the same time...
(Looks like Unicode, that I hate, is also my friend here)
